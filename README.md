# Background & Motivation
In my previous career, I wrote and prosecuted patent applications for tech companies.  For those not familiar with intellectual property law, patents are primarily rejected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or being inelligable subject matter as defined under 35 U.S. Code § 101, for being unpatentable because the idea can be shown to have been described or made obvious by prior art such publications made before the application was field. 

In the recent years, the Patent Office has had much difficulty in determining how to examine patents under § 101.  Numberous, often conflicting court decisions, have made it difficult for inventors to know whether their invention is patentable.  § 101 has proven particulary difficult for Applicants who attempt to patent software applications or code that that can be used in a generalizable manner.  Often times during patent prosecution the Patent Office will argue that a patent claim, e.g., related to a software/computing application is an `abstrat idea` if the process could be done mentally, or 






applications such as software applications which many not need to be tied to specific harware.
